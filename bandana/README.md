# Bandana
twoswap's bandana with a keychain containing a RPI pico and mini oled screen.

## Make your own bandana!
1. Get your pieces of fabric.
	- 22x22" square of blue fabric
	- 22x1.5" rectangle of yellow fabric (thin stripe)
	- 22x3" rectange of yellow fabric (thick stripe)
2. On the blue fabric, draw 0.5" margins with a air-fade marker.
3. On both pieces of yellow fabric, draw 0.5" margins on the longest side.
4. Sew the stripes onto the blue fabric.
5. Cut a clean 0.5" radius hole in a corner, using the gap between the stripes as the origin.
6. Insert a 3d printed (link soon) grommet into the hole.
7. YOU DID IT!
